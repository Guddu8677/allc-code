Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and multitasking is a feature that

allows your system to execute two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two 

sorts of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.

Process-based multitasking handles the concurrent execution of programs.

Thread-based multitasking deals with the multiprogramming of pieces of an equivalent program.

A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that will run concurrently. 

Each part of such a program is named a thread, and every thread defines a separate path of execution.

C++ doesnâ€™t contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. 

Instead, it relies entirely upon the OS to supply this feature
